<p>A short tutorial on some of the fundamentals of Graph Theory - including vertices, edges, degrees, cliques, colorings, and forbidden subgraphs. This is a project that I began working with Ridwan Syed on last winter in our Functional Programming class.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to update it to Elm 0.16 during this winter break and do some reworking of the interface to use some of those found in Sketch-n-sketch.</p>

<p>You can find the initial version of the demo here: <a href="GraphLife3.html">Graph Life 3</a></p>

<h3 id="overview-of-lesson">Overview of Lesson</h3>

<h4 id="1-degree">1. Degree</h4>
<p>Determine the degree of a given vertex by visual inspection</p>

<h4 id="2-cliques">2. Cliques</h4>
<p>Recognize what a clique is in a graph, and be able to notice cliques as part of a larger graph</p>

<h4 id="3-colorings">3. Colorings</h4>
<p>Learn how vertices can be colored, and the minimum number of colors needed to color a given graph</p>

<h4 id="4-forbidden-subgraph">4. Forbidden Subgraph</h4>
<p>Experiment with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_subgraph_problem">Forbidden Subgraph Problem</a></p>

<h4 id="5-sandbox">5. Sandbox</h4>
<p>A sandbox mode to play around with a large graph</p>

<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>

<p>We created a multi-level game that teaches a user basic graph theory by allowing them to directly manipulate the nodes and edges of a graph. On the technical side of things, our project consisted of several primary segments: firstly, is the underlying Graph data structure and and operations. We chose to design the structure as a construction of a dictionary of nodes and a list of edges – where an ‘edge’ is a tuple of keys corresponding to two nodes. Operation-wise, we implemented standard functions such as insertion, deletion, get, connect as well as additional more specific functions such as isClique and isOddCycle.</p>

<h4 id="phase-1">Phase 1</h4>
<p>We built up infrastructure to visualize the graphs and have them be interactive. This involved utilizing the elm-html library to create divs that would describe the visual attributes of the nodes and edges, at which point we added functionality from the Event sub-library of elm-html. This allowed nodes and edges to be clickable and hoverable, and send messages that could update the state of the graph.</p>

<h4 id="phase-2">Phase 2</h4>
<p>We created a gallery of functions which can be used to construct more complex graphs – n-sized cliques, peterson graphs, the szekeres snark, as well as the specific graphs for the levels that we have implemented.</p>

<h4 id="phase-3">Phase 3</h4>
<p>The interactions that we have implemented for the user include the highlighting of nodes and edges, the deletion of nodes and edges, the movement of nodes, and the collapsing of edges.</p>

<h4 id="phase-4">Phase 4</h4>
<p>We designed a levelling system that involves 4 specific topics of basic graph theory (degrees, cliques, colorings, and forbidden subgraphs) with each containing several levels of varying difficulties. We also provide with each level a short prompt with some hints, as well as the capability of resetting the level. We also provide a couple sandboxes with larger graphs in them so as to allow for more freeform graph interactions.</p>
