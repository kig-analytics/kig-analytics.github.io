<p>At KIG CRE LLC. we have been building a tool to make the development site selection process more dynamic and efficient. With this tool, a developer can parametrize by zoning, TOD areas, land square footage, and the total buildable square footage on a site.</p>

<h3 id="filtering-zoning">Filtering Zoning</h3>

<p>The first parameter many developers encounter in terms of site selection is zoning. Often, an owner has a specific zoning class or range in mind</p>

<h3 id="tod-areas">TOD Areas</h3>

<p>Filter down by TOD areas. Transit-Oriented Development is critical to many developers. Our tool enables filtering zoning and building information by their distance from a particular transit node. In this example we utilize the data from the CTA L line and the Metra Commuter Line stations as our transit nodes.</p>

<p>Eventually the tool will enable selection of specific transit nodes and realtime adjustent of the desired ditance from a node.</p>

<h3 id="existing-current-structure-data">Existing Current Structure Data</h3>

<p>Next, it’s critical to understand the current structures and their information that lie within the resulting zoning districts from Zoning &amp; TOD filtering. Associated information includes year built, number of floors, and square footage - all useful in determing the difficulty of developing upon a site.</p>

<p>Note: Chicago footprint data does not have accurate building square footage data for all buildings in the city - unknown square footages are replaced with a zero.</p>

<h3 id="determine-building-potential">Determine Building Potential</h3>

<p>Utilizing the FAR associated with a particular zoning class, we can calculate the maximum allowable floor area for a potential development in an area:</p>

<p>In the future, we could add other ordinaces and bonuses that city’s can award for affordable housing or sustainable development practices.</p>

<h3 id="data-diligence-and-owner-identification">Data Diligence and Owner Identification</h3>

<p>With our work with the Chicago datasets, we have found that updates often occur only on an annual or bi-annual basis. The resulting erosion of accuracy requires diligence with more up-to-date sources on the current use, zoning, and ownership of a given site.</p>

<p>For verifying ownership, we can also add an additional layer for parcel mapping, able to reveal associated ownership information from local assessor and recorder offices.</p>

<h3 id="goal--scaling">Goal &amp; Scaling</h3>

<p>A singular experience of being able to add or remove any parameter layers of interest- including zoning, TOD areas (including specific locations, adjustable radii), current building footprints, buildable square footage, and ownership data.</p>

<p>Once complete, this tool could easily be scaled to other metropolitan areas within the United States. The primary requirement would be complete and up-to-date open datatsets from city and county governments. The datasets needed would include citywide zoning and building footprint GIS data, as well as countywide parcel GIS data. A zoning key used to understand the allowable FAR associated with each zoning class would also be useful.</p>
