  <section class="post-content"><p>The original target medium of the <a href="http://ravichugh.github.io/sketch-n-sketch/">Sketch-n-Sketch</a> tool was SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). However, the paradigm of prodirect manipulation has the potential across a broad spectrum of graphical software including data visualization, web and UI design, document preparation systems, and even 3D digital fabrication design.</p>

<p>While each of these domains have very different purposes - and each faces unique challenges - the current landscape of tools for each of them have surprising parallels to the same issues Sketch-n-Sketch deals confronts with SVG editors.</p>

<h4 id="benefits-in-3d-digital-fabrication-design">Benefits in 3D Digital Fabrication Design</h4>

<p>As 3D printing and other manufacturing have grown in popularity, the number and complexity of tools in the arena has also grown. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_computer-aided_design_editors">list</a> of CAD applications and their associated languages have a wide range of strengths - often a result of targeting a specific use case in manufacturing or design. <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> is a popular, open-source and lightweight editor. The UI follows a similar dynamic to Sketch-n-Sketch’s (and other <a href="http://elm-lang.org/examples/time">graphical</a> <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">editors’</a>) interface, with lefthand pane for code and a righthand pane for the resulting object.</p>

<div>

<p><em>An example design in OpenSCAD, from the <a href="http://www.tridimake.com/2014/09/how-to-use-openscad-tricks-and-tips-to.html">tridimake tutorial</a></em></p>

<p>Currently, OpenSCAD utilizes a programmatic approach to object manipulation. Somewhat similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">little</code> for Sketch-n-Skecth, the OpenSCAD language employs <code class="highlighter-rouge">object()</code> functions such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">polyhedron()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sphere()</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cylinder()</code> with parameter arguments to define geometric objects which are then rendered. Recently, OpenSCAD has begun an <a href="https://amarjeetkapoor1.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/user-interface-for-customizing-models/">effort</a> to enable some use of direct manipulation through the implementation of widgets. While still in its early stages, this suggests that OpenSCAD is moving closer to enable prodirect manipulation.</p>

<p>Many other CAD tools, such as Autodesk’s <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview">AutoCAD</a> and Ultimaker’s <a href="https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software">Cura</a> take a decidedly direct approach to manipulating 3D objects.</p>

<p>With both of these approaches to CAD, we see some of the same classic challenges - the tediousness of iteration in OpenSCAD’s case and the limited ability to define complex relationships in the case of direct CAD tools. To see how programmatic augmentation might assist these tools, let us examine common use cases. In the case of OpenSCAD, rapid development of models is always a goal - however this can be hampered by the number of arguments that OpenSCAD functions can require (particularly for the many coordinate arguments for complicated polyhedral objects).</p>

<p>It is often best practice to create functions to calculate these coordinates (the archimedean solids are good examples of these), but some designs do not fall easily into the realm of being defined functionally. In these instances, having the ability to directly manipulate the object - and have these changes reflected in its <code class="highlighter-rouge">.scad</code> file - would be greatly beneficial.</p>

<p>In direct manipulation tools like AutoCAD, it can often be the case that a designer or engineer wishes to have multiple dimensions correlate to another in particular ways. For example, imagine the blueprint of a room in AutoCAD. What if an engineer wishes to insert <code class="highlighter-rouge">f(x)</code> number of evenly spaced windows along a wall of the house, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> is the length of that wall (and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> could be changed at any time)? Or what if the engineer wished to change the spacing between each window, but have them all remain equal? Or retain the existing spacing but change the size of the windows?</p>

<p>Autodesk has put a significant time and effort into enabling complex interactions and relationships between objects in AutoCAD. The large set of helpful additional tools and widgets could very well be able to handle the situation outlined above. However, a programmatic interface for structuring relationships between different scalar quantities in an object would be an elegant solution. On one hand, it may prove to initially be more difficult to learn for those uninitiated with coding. On the other hand, it could be a means of expanding the horizon of allowable interactions with an object.</p>

<h4 id="benefits-in-data-visualization">Benefits in Data Visualization</h4>

<p>Data Visualization has become a growing and important field in many areas, from academia to the press. Many a published scientific paper, regardless of field, is accompanied by a set of charts and diagrams. Many major news publications such as the New York Times or the Washington Post employ extensive use of data visualization; <a href="fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight’s</a> central focus is exploring issues through data analysis and visualization. Whatever the purpose, data visualization in any of these domains is constructed via programmatic (<a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RGraphics/rgraphics.html">R</a>, <a href="d3js.org">D3.js</a>) or direct manipulation (Adobe Illustrator, PowerPoint).</p>

<p>What might be some of the advantages of prodirect manipulation in the realm of Data Visualization? Traditionally programmatic tools could benefit from speedier development of the foundational structure of visualizations - length and demarcation of axes, data labeling, sizing of charts. Traditionally direct tools could benefit from increased flexibility to create unique charts. Currently, such applications often involve a number of ‘cookie-cutter’ charts which can fail to fully depict data to a user’s satisfaction - to mention nothing of aesthetics.</p>

<p>One potentially interesting emergent behavior is the editing of a source data set via direct manipulation. Under a prodirect paradigm, a dataset can be treated as a collection of constants that can be toggled by interaction with the graphical object. This might lead to several interesting use cases. For complex and / or multidimensional data models where there are clearly defined relationships between constants, manipulation could reveal insights that might otherwise be difficult to notice. One could also imagine novel ways of collecting new data from user participants via interacting directly with the visualization.</p>

<h4 id="benefits-in-web-and-ui-design">Benefits in Web and UI Design</h4>

<p>While the space of Web and UI Design is one that is continually evolving with new tools, it is nevertheless another area that is divided between programmatic and direct tools. Once entirely composed of programmatic development with raw coding of HTML / CSS / javascript, tools aimed at lessening coding interaction like <a href="squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>, <a href="wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>, and <a href="wix.com">Wix</a>. Programmatic tools have also evolved; commonly used accesories like Chrome <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/">devtools</a> allow for more dynamic interaction with webpages and new <a href="elm-lang.org">languages</a> abstract away micromanagement of javascript and styling.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Chrome Devtools in action, source: <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/">Chrome Devtool tutorial</a></em></p>

<p>One could imagine a modified version of a browser devtool which would also facilitate prodirect manipulation. Many browser devtools already implement highlighting around <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code>s and other html objects; a prodirect browser devtool would allow these to be interactable in the same fashion as Sketch-n-sketch. This would particularly helpful in development situations when the code for a webpage is complex, and finding the proper variable to modify is either non-obvious or tedious.</p>

<h4 id="benefits-in-document-preparation-systems">Benefits in Document Preparation Systems</h4>

<p>Documentation preparation or typesetting systems such as <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> utilize a programmatic interface to manipulate a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tex</code> file that is subsequently compiled into a fully formatted and styled document. However, just as with many programmatic manipulation interfaces, this can often lead to tedious trial-and-error corrections - often when an author has already decided on the exact look and composition of a document.</p>

<p>The premium in academic document preparation systems, LaTeX is famous (and infamous) for its use of programmatic manipulation. A user often desires control and rapid iteration from LaTeX tools such as <a href="www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">Texmaker</a> or <a href="sharetlatex.com">sharelatex</a>. However, a user can frequently run into undesired formatting - particularly when using more complex or obsure packages - that are tedious to remediate through code editing.</p>

<p>A user armed with a prodirect typesetting tool could correct a formatting error: misaligned columns, elements that are un-centered, images that are not sized correctly and many other such issues. The user can then spend less time being preoccupied by the precise aethetics of their piece and more on the content they are writing.</p>
