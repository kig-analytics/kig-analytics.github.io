I'm a recent graduate of computer science from the University of Chicago. My main interests there were data visualization and functional programming.

Most recently, I completed an internship at a bran splinter new startup called the Academic Venture Exchange - where I helped develop an initial product and help gain feedback from our initial cohort of 13 universities and ~70 entrepreneurs. The Academic Venture Exchange is designed to become a marketplace for university research to be matched to experienced entrepreneurs who can steer them into successful startups. 

At University, I've been a research assistant involved in building the Sketch-n-sketch graphical manipulation tool. Imagine a code-based graphics interface - in the line of tools like OpenSCAD or LaTeX. Now imagine if you could manipulate some piece of the actual graphic and have the underlying code update itself before your eyes in real time to reflect your changes. That's the goal of the [Sketch-n-sketch](ravichugh.github.io/sketch-n-sketch/) tool, with SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) as its current target output.

I also worked as the Senior Member of the internship program at UChicagoTech, the University's Center for Ventures & Technology Development, where I curated and analyzed data on the University's interactions with companies, VCs, and entrepreneurs interested in the University's intellectual property.

<!-- On my free time, I kayak on Lake Michigan when the weather's pleasant. I occasionally try my hand at painting and making other art pieces. I'm also a big fan of tabletop roleplaying games like D&D, Pathfinder, and Diplomacy. TODO: work on fluff talk-->
